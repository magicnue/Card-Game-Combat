Ever wanted to have \_Slay the Spire\_ or \_Library of Ruina\_\\-style deckbuilding combat in your games? \*\*Card Game Combat\*\* plugin turns an Actor's Skill List into a deck of Cards; making each battle in your game an epic duel of deckbuilding and wit.



This plugin suite comes with a \*\*Demo Project\*\* to help you get acquainted with how Card Game Combat works, \*\*Blank Templates\*\* that lets you quickly start a new project without too much setup and some free visual assets.

Now also available on Steam as RPG Maker Official DLC.



\*\*Plugin Features\*\*



\*   Convert default RPG Maker Combat to that of a Deckbuilder Card Game.

\*   Create Cards with different effects and costs, including card-game-specific abilities like drawing, discarding, or burning cards, shuffling the deck, etc.

\*   Customize cards easily with Templates, Art, Fonts, Icons, and Descriptions.

\*   Change how the Deckbuilder UI looks for both the Front and Side View battles: Moving, scaling, rotating, or hiding various components.

\*   Give each Actor a custom deck to determine their available actions, letting them enter the fray with a unique deck and playstyle.

\*   Have Damage Formulas and Variables factor in values such as Deck Size, Hand Size, Discard Size, etc.
