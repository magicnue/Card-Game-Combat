How Decks Work
==============

**Card Game Combat** turns all Skills in the Database into cards, and turns the player’s Skill Selection into a Hand. An Actor's Deck is composed of all the Skills they have learned. Any time an Actor **learns** a Skill, they add that skill’s Card to their Deck. Likewise, whenever they **forget** a skill, that Skill's Card is removed from their Deck.

For Battles, it adds a **Hand**, **Deck** and a **Discard** pile as zones for cards to go. Cards are drawn from the Deck to the Hand. On turns, players can select Cards in hand to play. After Cards are played, they are moved to the Discard. By Default, once the Deck is emptied, the Discard Pile is shuffled back into the Deck.

An Actor can learn the same skill multiple times to get multiple copies of the same card. Any skill learned mid-battle will automatically be forgotten at the end of the battle, meaning cards can be temporarily added to the deck mid-battle.

Make sure to give actors enough skills before the first battle that they can run a deck. You can do this by adding Skills to the Skills to Learn section of their Class in the Database.
