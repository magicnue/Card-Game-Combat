**Card Game Combat** is a plugin suite developed by MythAtelier for use in RPG Maker MV/MZ to allow for combat gameplay similar to that seen in roguelike deckbuilders such as _Slay the Spire_ to work using the engines' existing Skill system. This Documentation Wiki covers what you need to know to get the plugin working and how to use its various features to create your own game projects.

We are also developing a Tutorial Video Series that covers this info in a more entertaining format. Give that a go if the Wiki seems a little dry.

Plugin Suite
============

Here is a list of all the plugins we have developed as part of the Card Game Combat project.

| Foundation | Expansions | Patreon Only |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Engine | Deck Editor | Card Particle FX |
| Card Types (Plugin) | Card Shop | Card Library Plus |
| Equip Cards | Card Summons | Turn Start Plus |

| **Foundation** plugins are available to all users that have bought our plugin on itch.io and Steam. These plugins constitute what is the base functionality of Card Game Combat which the Expansion plugins build on top of. | **Expansion** plugins are sizable plugins that add entirely new scenes or systems to your game project. These are meant to expand the scope of Card Game Combat beyond that of a roguelike deckbuilder.They must be bought separately as not all CGC users may require them. | **Patreon Only** plugins are available to Rare and Legendary Tier members of our Patreon. Joining will give you access to these exclusive plugins as well as the ability to vote on what plugins we should work on next. |

**(\*)** label is used to indicate plugins that have been planned but not in active development yet.
